# CalVer (or Calendar Versioning) release model

TIL (Today I learnt), what is CalVer!

_But some context & notes first:_

During a work meeting today, there was a discussion around [recent changes in docker's release cadence](https://forums.docker.com/t/docker-engine-release-cadence-vs-semver-major-version-numbers/141131) (for major version releases), as well as its move from a `CalVer`release model to a more `SemVer`(-ish) model.

At the same time, I also realised the [docker/docker-ce](https://github.com/docker/docker-ce/blob/master/README.md) github repo is archived as of Oct 14, 2024 and is no-longer the "source of truth" for Docker CE builds.

> The commit SHA and tag for Docker CLI build will come from the docker/cli repository and the commit SHA and tag for the Docker Engine will come from the moby/moby repository.

### So, what is CalVer?

The "CalVer" (Calendar Versioning) versioning scheme is a versioning method based on dates rather than arbitrary numbers or semantic versioning (SemVer). It uses elements of the calendar date to define the version, which typically includes the year, and sometimes the month or even the day. This scheme provides a clear understanding of when a particular version was released.

_**CalVer typically includes:**_

1. **Year**: Indicating the release year.
2. **Month**: Indicating the release month.
3. **Day**: Indicating the specific release day (less common).
4. **Additional Identifiers**: Such as a minor revision number for patches or updates within the same period.

Examples:
- `20.04` (April 2020)
- `21.10` (October 2021)

Ubuntu, also uses CalVer for its release cycle. Here's how it applies to Ubuntu:

1. **Regular Releases**:
   - Ubuntu follows a six-month release cycle, with new versions released in April and October each year.
   - The version numbers reflect the year and month of release. For example, Ubuntu 20.04 was released in April 2020, and Ubuntu 21.10 was released in October 2021.

2. **LTS (Long-Term Support) Releases**:
   - Every two years, in April, Ubuntu releases an LTS version. These versions are supported for five years with updates and patches.
   - LTS versions are also named using CalVer, such as Ubuntu 20.04 LTS and Ubuntu 22.04 LTS.

### Benefits of CalVer
1. **Predictability**: Users and developers can easily predict when the next release will happen based on the calendar.
2. **Clarity**: The version number clearly indicates the release date, making it easy to determine the age of the software.
3. **Consistency**: Regular and predictable release cycles help in planning upgrades and deployments.

### Comparison to Other Versioning Schemes
- **SemVer (Semantic Versioning)**: Uses a MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH structure, focusing on the significance of changes (e.g., `2.1.0`).
- **CalVer**: Focuses on the release date rather than the nature of the changes.
